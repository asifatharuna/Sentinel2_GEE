This project demonstrates how to efficiently prepare a dense optical Sentinel-2 time series using the distributed cloud platform of Google Earth Engine.   

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform that allows researchers, scientists, and developers to access and analyze vast amounts of satellite imagery and geospatial data. It provides a wide array of tools and functions for processing, visualizing, and interpreting Earth observation data, enabling users to derive insights about land use, climate, ecosystems, and more. Google Earth Engine's integration of remote sensing data with computing power simplifies complex geospatial analysis tasks and promotes environmental monitoring and research on a global scale.
